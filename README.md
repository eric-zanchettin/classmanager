<h1 align="center">Class Manager - Project</h1>
<h2>üìú Introduction</h2>
<p>Class Manager is an simple Website created during my learning in <b>Rocketseat Launchbase Bootcamp</b> where the students 
were requested of doing an app to serve as an Class Controlling app.</p>
<p>That was one of the first applications made on the Bootcamp and was made for educational purposes. In that Website, the School director register new teachers, students and
can associate them to create a correlation beetween these teachers and students. The Website asks teachers about their knowledge and which classes them can teach to create the
possibilitie to any student to filter and choose their classes based on their interests.</p>
<h2>üë®‚Äçüíª Technologies</h2>
<p><b>The project was built with the use of the following technologies:</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Node.js;</li>
  <li>JavaScript;</li>
  <li>PostgreSQL;</li>
  <li>HTML5;</li>
  <li>CSS3.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>And used the following libs/frameworks:</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>express.js;</li>
  <li>nunjucks.</li>
</ul>
<h2>üöÄ Setting up</h2>
<p>To start using the application, download it and store it in an node.js enviroment, then, in an terminal with the opened project type:</p>
<p>If you preffer to use git to clone my repository, use the following steps in your node.js enviroment:</p>
<div align="center">
  <code width="900px">
    git init
  </code>
  <code width="900px">
    git clone https://github.com/eric-zanchettin/classmanager.git
  </code>
</div>
<p>If you choose or not to use git, these are the same following steps:</p>
<div align="center">
  <code width="900px">npm install</code>
</div>
<p>This will install all dependencies used on this project, after that, you need to create an PostgreSQL database with these specifications:</p>
<code>
           
            CREATE DATABASE teachers
            
            CREATE TABLE teachers (
            id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
            avatar_url TEXT,
            name TEXT,
            birth	TIMESTAMP,
            formation TEXT,
            classtype	TEXT,
            classes INT,
           	created_at TIMESTAMP
            )
            
            CREATE TABLE students (
            id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
            avatar_url TEXT,
            name TEXT,
           	birth TIMESTAMP,
            email TEXT,
            grade TEXT,
            hours INT,
            teacher_id INT,
              CONSTRAINT fk_teacher_id
              	FOREIGN KEY(teacher_id)
              		REFERENCES teachers(id)
            )
</code>
<p><b>IMPORTANT:</b> Remember to change the db.js inside the config file informing your credentials to the PostegreSQL Pool!!!</p>

</p>
<p>Now you just have to run the server with:</p>
<div align="center">
  <code width="900px">npm start</code>
</div>
<p>To start the server and access http://localhost:3000 to start using the website.</p>

<h2>What is <b>Rocketseat Launchbase Bootcamp?</b></h2>
<p>Rocketseat Launchbase is a Bootcamp with the purpose of leveraging the career of those who participate getting straight to the point of programming: CODE!
It is a incredible way of getting the first steps on programming and also, a very good way to expand your knowledge and get to the next level of programming. If you want to know more, feel free to check out <a href="https://github.com/Rocketseat">their GitHub</a> as well.</p>
